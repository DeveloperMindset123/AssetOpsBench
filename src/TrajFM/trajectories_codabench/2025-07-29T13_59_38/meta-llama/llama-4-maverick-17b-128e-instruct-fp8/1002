These include sensors that measure variations in electrical resistance, conductivity, or material thickness for 'Corrosion'; changes in pressure, vibration, flow rate, or temperature for 'Leakage'; and changes in impurity levels, performance metrics, or unusual spikes in readings for 'Contamination'.
