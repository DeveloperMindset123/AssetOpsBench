# Track 1 Submission Guidelines

This document provides the steps required to prepare, test, and submit your work to **CodaBench** for the **AssetOpsBench Competition**, more specific for **Track 1**.

---

## 0. Prerequisites for Track 1 Competition

Please ensure the competition code is ready on your local machine.  
Refer to the [README_CODS.md](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/Competition_CODS/benchmark/cods_track1/README_CODS.md) for details.

1. **Clone the Repository Locally**  
   - Use GitHub Desktop, CLI, or another tool to clone your fork of [IBM/AssetOpsBench](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench).  
   - Make sure you are on the **`Competition_CODS`** branch.  
   - Recommended local path:  
     ```
     <your_local_directory>/codabench/AssetOpsBench
     ```

2. **Verify Setup**  
   
   - Confirm that the branch is set to `Competition_CODS`.  
   - Your local files should match the competition branch.
   
3. **Code Editing Environment**  
   - You can use **Visual Studio Code** or any other IDE/text editor to view, modify, and test the code locally.



## 1. Access the Track 1 Competition  

### Access the CodaBench AssetOpsBench ‚Äî Track 1 Page  

1. Open the CodaBench website:  
   üëâ [https://www.codabench.org/](https://www.codabench.org/)  

2. Log in with your account credentials.  

3. Navigate to the **AssetOpsBench Competition** page:

## 2. Understand Your Competition ‚Äì Track 1  

- The challenge is about **better planning prompts** ‚Äî all teams use the same fixed agents, ReAct agent, and Executor.  
- For **local testing**, you can use the baseline scaffold in **[`planning_review.py`](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/Competition_CODS/src/agent_hive/workflows/planning_review.py)**.  
  - Local path after cloning: `src/agent_hive/workflows/planning_review.py`  
  - This file lets you **practice and debug locally** with a few sample scenarios.  
  - It shows you what kind of output a planning prompt produces and helps verify your setup.  
  - It is **not submitted** ‚Äî only for local testing.  
- For the **official submission**, you must edit **[`track1_planning.py`](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/Competition_CODS/src/agent_hive/workflows/track1_planning.py)**.  
  - Local path after cloning: `src/agent_hive/workflows/track1_planning.py`  
  - Only the marked **TODO** section can be modified to improve how agent information is collected and formatted.  
- Submissions are evaluated with **LLaMA-3-70B** on public scenarios (Phase 1) and unseen scenarios (Phase 2); final scores combine **task accomplishment** and **generalization**.

## 3. What Need to Do

There are **two TODO sections** in `src/agent_hive/workflows/track1_planning.py`:

1. **Scenario 1 ‚Äì Agent Info Formatting**  
   - **Where:** `generate_steps()` (lines 59‚Äì82)  
   - **Allowed:**  
     - Change numbering style or bullet points  
     - Include additional metadata (e.g., agent capabilities, tags)  
     - Provide examples in a different format  
     - Add emojis or formatting to make the prompt clearer  
     - More thinking  

2. **Scenario 2 ‚Äì Prompt Template**  
   - **Where:** `get_prompt()` (lines 161‚Äì191)  
   - **Allowed:**  
     - Wording  
     - Structure  
     - Examples  
     - Emojis  

üëâ To find them quickly, search in the file for:

   - Ensure the ZIP contains all required files (e.g., your Python scripts, configuration files, and any dependencies as specified in the task instructions).  
   - Double-check that your main script matches the expected entrypoint.
