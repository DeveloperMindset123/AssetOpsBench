# AssetOpsBench Setup Guide

This guide describes how to fork, configure, and run the **AssetOpsBench** project using Conda and Docker on macOS.

---

## Fork to Your Own Project

This guide shows how to create your own copy of the **IBM/AssetOpsBench** project on GitHub, using only the web browser.  
A fork lets you experiment and make changes without affecting the original project.

---

### Step 1 ‚Äî Log in to GitHub
1. Open [https://github.com](https://github.com) in your browser.  
2. Sign in with your GitHub account.  
   - If you don‚Äôt have one, click **Sign up** to create a free account.

---

### Step 2 ‚Äî Navigate to the Original Repository
1. In the search bar at the top of GitHub, type **IBM/AssetOpsBench**.  
2. Click on the repository link, or go directly to:  
   üëâ [https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench)

---

### Step 3 ‚Äî Required Branch for This Work
The repository contains multiple branches, but for this purpose you will only use:

- **`Competition_CODS`** ‚Üí this branch contains the competition-specific code and materials.  

üëâ You still need to fork with **all branches** available so you can access `Competition_CODS`.

---

### Step 4 ‚Äî Create the Fork
1. On the top-right of the page, click the **Fork** button.  
   ![fork-button](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-30686/images/help/repository/fork_button.png)  

2. On the fork setup page:  
   - Make sure your own GitHub account is selected as the destination.  
   - **Important:** Uncheck the option **‚ÄúCopy the `main` branch only.‚Äù**  
     - Leaving it checked will copy only `main`.  
     - Unchecking ensures you also get **`Competition_CODS`** and other branches.  

3. Click **Create fork**.

---

### Step 5 ‚Äî Switch to the `Competition_CODS` Branch
1. Go to your forked repository:  
   üëâ `https://github.com/<your-username>/AssetOpsBench`

2. Open the **Branch dropdown menu** (upper-left, just above the file list).  
   ![branch-dropdown](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-33248/images/help/branch/branch-dropdown.png)

3. Select **`Competition_CODS`** from the list.  
   - This switches your forked repository view to the competition branch.  

---

### Step 6 ‚Äî Verify Your Fork
- After switching, confirm that the branch name `Competition_CODS` is shown at the top-left of the repository.  
- All further work for the competition should be done in this branch.

---

### Important Notes
- Always uncheck **‚ÄúCopy the `main` branch only‚Äù** when forking. Otherwise you won‚Äôt see `Competition_CODS`.  
- Even though other branches are copied, you only need to use **`Competition_CODS`** for this competition.


## 2. Clone to Your Local Machine (Using GitHub Desktop)

Once you have forked the repository on GitHub, you may want to work with it locally on your computer.  
Here we use **GitHub Desktop** to illustrate the process.

---

### Step 1 ‚Äî Install GitHub Desktop
1. Download GitHub Desktop from: https://desktop.github.com  
2. Install and open the application.  
3. Sign in with your GitHub account.

---

### Step 2 ‚Äî Locate Your Fork
1. In your browser, go to your forked repository:  
   `https://github.com/<your-username>/AssetOpsBench`
2. Click the green **Code** button.  
3. Select **Open with GitHub Desktop**.  
   - This will launch GitHub Desktop and prepare to clone your fork.

---

### Step 3 ‚Äî Choose the Local Path
1. In GitHub Desktop, choose where to save the project locally.  
2. Set the path to:
	local path:  <your_local_directory>/codabench/AssetOpsBench
	

### Step 4 ‚Äî Switch to the `Competition_CODS` Branch
‚ö†Ô∏è For this competition, you must work **only** on the `Competition_CODS` branch.

1. In GitHub Desktop, use the **Current Branch** dropdown (top bar).  
2. Select `Competition_CODS` from the list.  
   - If you don‚Äôt see it, ensure you unchecked ‚ÄúCopy the main branch only‚Äù when you forked.

---

### Step 5 ‚Äî Verify
1. The branch name shown at the top of GitHub Desktop should be **Competition_CODS**.  
2. Confirm the file view matches the content of this branch.

---

‚úÖ You have successfully cloned your fork locally with GitHub Desktop and switched to the **`Competition_CODS`** branch. All further work should be done in this branch.




## 3. Docker Setup (Rancher Desktop)

We use **Rancher Desktop** for the Docker CLI and engine. Install it from [https://rancherdesktop.io](https://rancherdesktop.io).

### 3.1 Install & Configure
1. Open **Rancher Desktop** ‚Üí **Preferences**.  
2. Go to **Virtual Machine ‚Üí Emulation**:  
   - **Virtual Machine Type**:  
     - `VZ` (recommended on Apple Silicon) ‚Üí uses the Apple Virtualization framework.  
     - `QEMU` ‚Üí software emulator (slower, only if VZ is unavailable).  
   - **VZ Option**: enable **Rosetta support** to run amd64 (x86) Docker images on Apple Silicon.  
3. Click **Apply**. Rancher Desktop will restart with the new settings.

### 3.2 (Optional) Verify the Docker CLI
You can check that the `docker` command is coming from Rancher Desktop.

```bash
which docker
docker version
```

**Expected path (example):**
```
~/.rd/bin/docker
```

- On macOS this expands to `/Users/<your-username>/.rd/bin/docker`.  
- On Linux it expands to `/home/<your-username>/.rd/bin/docker`.  

If you see `/usr/local/bin/docker`, another Docker runtime (e.g., Docker Desktop) is active. Quit it and ensure Rancher Desktop is running.

### 3.3 (If Kubernetes is On) Ensure Certificates Are Fresh
If you enable Kubernetes in Rancher Desktop, its certificates can expire and block startup.

**Quick checks:**
```bash
kubectl version --short
kubectl get nodes
kubectl cluster-info
```

**If errors mention expired or invalid certificates:**
- In Rancher Desktop: go to **Preferences ‚Üí Kubernetes ‚Üí Reset Kubernetes** (regenerates certificates).  
- If problems persist: use **Preferences ‚Üí Troubleshooting ‚Üí Factory Reset** (removes images/containers and resets certificates).

## 4. Build and Run


### Pre-built Docker Images
We provide two base Docker images `quay.io/assetopsbench/assetopsbench-basic` and `quay.io/assetopsbench/assetopsbench-extra` which serves as the AssetOpsBench environment. The base images provide
- `quay.io/assetopsbench/assetopsbench-basic`: A minimal Python 3.12 environment with only essential Python packages installed. Suitable for lightweight benchmarking tasks or custom setup.
- `quay.io/assetopsbench/assetopsbench-extra`: A full-featured Python 3.12 environment with all components pre-installed, including Individual agents (e.g., IoT Agent), MetaAgent, and AgentHive.

The python environment in both docker images use Conda to manage. The name of pre-built Conda environment is `assetopsbench`. For full list of installed packages, please refer to [basic_requirements.txt](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/basic_requirements.txt) and [extra_requirements.txt](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/extra_requirements.txt).

### CouchDB Setup

To streamline access to asset data during benchmarking, we use a Dockerized CouchDB instance. This setup allows for easy loading, querying, and management of benchmark datasets within a consistent environment.

A sample [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/docker-compose.yml) is provided to help you start CouchDB locally with default configuration and credentials. We use [couchdb_setup.sh](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/couchdb_setup.sh) as starting command to create a CouchDB database populating with a [sample Chiller dataset](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/src/assetopsbench/sample_data/chiller6_june2020_sensordata_couchdb.csv).


### Run Benchmark Script
In [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/docker-compose.yml), we mount the benchmark scripts ([entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/entrypoint.sh) and [run_plan_execute.py](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/run_plan_execute.py) and scenario files as volumes to assetopsbench container.

Now we run the following command,

```commandline
cd /path/to/AssetOpsBench
chmod +x benchmark/cods/entrypoint_track_1.sh
docker-compose -f benchmark/docker-compose.yml up
```

You can use [.env](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/.env) or add your environment variables to `.env` which can be passed to containers through `docker-compose.yml`.

 Note that in `entrypoint.sh`, we activate the python environment by `conda activate assetopsbench` first.
