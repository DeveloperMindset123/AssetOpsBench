# [AAAI 2026] From Inception to Productization: Hands-on Lab for the Lifecycle of Multimodal Agentic AI in Industry 4.0

### Introduction
Welcome to our interactive lab session at **AAAI 2026**! ðŸŽ‰  
This lab focuses on **Agentic AI** in Industry 4.0, where autonomous agents must reason across multimodal data sources (sensor streams, structured knowledge graphs, maintenance logs) and operate adaptively under uncertainty.  

Participants will gain **hands-on experience** with data integration, benchmarking, and evaluation of multimodal agents. The lab bridges concepts of symbolic-neural integration, agent reasoning strategies, and real-world evaluation workflows. By the end of the session, attendees will leave with the practical skills and modular tools needed to build trustworthy, explainable, and deployable **Agentic AI systems**.
