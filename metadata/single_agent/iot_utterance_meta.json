  "Dataset Characteristics": "A small collection of IoT-focused utterance scenarios used to evaluate agent behavior for IoT discovery and data retrieval tasks. Each record contains an id, type, textual prompt, category, and a `characteristic_form` describing the expected response or file reference.",

  "Summary": "20 IoT-related scenario utterances (iot_utterance_meta.json) for AssetOpsBench. Scenarios ask agents to list sites, enumerate assets at sites, and return references to files or textual lists for IoT resources.",
  "Description": "This JSON file (`iot_utterance_meta.json`) contains 20 records of IoT-focused prompts used in AssetOpsBench. Each entry guides an agent through simple IoT discovery tasks (e.g., listing available sites, listing assets at the MAIN site). The `characteristic_form` field describes the expected return value or file reference. Use this file to validate agent capability to discover and reference IoT resources correctly and without hallucination.",
