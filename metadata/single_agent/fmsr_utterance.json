  "Dataset Characteristics": "A small collection of single-agent utterance scenarios focused on failure-mode and root-cause knowledge (e.g., lists of failure modes for assets such as Chiller and Wind Turbine). Each record contains an id, a textual prompt, and a `characteristic_form` describing the expected response; some entries are marked deterministic.",
  "Feature Type": "Categorical (id), Text (text, characteristic_form), Boolean/flag (deterministic)",
  "Associated Tasks": "Knowledge retrieval, failure mode enumeration, deterministic-answer evaluation, single-agent prompt testing, NLP extraction of domain-specific lists",

  "Summary": "20 single-agent scenario utterances for failure-mode and root-cause tasks (fmsr_utterance.json). Includes deterministic expected outputs for many prompts; used to validate single-agent knowledge and extraction behavior.",
  "Description": "This JSON file (`fmsr_utterance.json`) contains 20 records of single-agent prompts used in AssetOpsBench focusing on failure modes (e.g., for Chiller, Chiller 6, Wind Turbine). The `characteristic_form` field often contains the canonical or expected list of failure modes. Use this file to evaluate correctness of single-agent knowledge responses, extraction fidelity, and handling of deterministic vs non-deterministic queries.",
