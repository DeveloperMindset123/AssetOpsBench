  "Dataset Characteristics": "Collection of TSFM-related utterance scenarios used to evaluate time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, model discovery, finetuning and evaluation workflows.

  "Summary": "23 TSFM-related scenario utterances (tsfm_utterance.json) for AssetOpsBench. Scenarios ask agents about supported time-series analysis tasks, available pretrained models, and whether forecasting/anomaly detection is supported.",
  "Description": "This JSON file (`tsfm_utterance.json`) contains 23 records of prompts used to evaluate TSFM capabilities in the AssetOpsBench benchmark. Entries commonly request lists of supported tasks (e.g., forecasting, anomaly detection), available pretrained model checkpoints (e.g., ttm_96_28), or confirmations that forecasting models are supported. Use this file to validate that agents correctly enumerate available TSFM capabilities, reference correct model checkpoints/paths, and answer deterministically where expected.",
