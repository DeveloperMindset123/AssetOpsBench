  "Dataset Characteristics": "A collection of work-order related utterance scenarios used to evaluate agent retrieval, summarization, and filtering logic for maintenance records. Each record contains an id, textual prompt, type (Workorder), optional deterministic flag, and a `characteristic_form` describing expected results (counts, filters by equipment and year, distribution summaries).",
  "Feature Type": "Categorical (id, type, deterministic), Text (text, characteristic_form), small structured fields (e.g., expected counts)",
  "Associated Tasks": "Work-order retrieval, aggregation (counts by code/month), preventive vs corrective filtering, asset-year filtering, NLP-to-query translation for maintenance systems",

  "Summary": "36 work-order scenario utterances (wo_utterance.json) for AssetOpsBench. Scenarios ask agents to fetch, filter, and summarize work orders for specific equipment and year ranges (e.g., equipment CWC04013 in 2017).",
  "Description": "This JSON file (`wo_utterance.json`) contains 36 prompt records used to evaluate agent behavior on maintenance work-order tasks. Entries request retrieval of work orders for specific equipment and time windows, summaries of work-order distribution by code or month, and filtering by preventive vs corrective types. Many entries are deterministic and contain expected counts to validate correct filtering and aggregation.",
